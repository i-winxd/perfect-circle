# Perfect circle

A program that moves your mouse in a circle

## Running

You need to have Python installed on your computer, and you need to know how to run Python files on your computer. I think I've put tutorials in my other repositories.

## What this program does

Immediately takes control over your mouse and moves it in the shape of a circle counterclockwise, starting from the 3 oclock position, and completing slightly more than one loop.

This program does not click the mouse for you.

Your mouse will move to your FIRST monitor. For Windows, that is your monitor with the "type here to search" on your taskbar.

It is difficult to stop this program once you start running it, so make sure you know what you are doing.
